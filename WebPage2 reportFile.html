            <dd>Online education is an amenable instructional delivery process that includes 
              any learning that takes place via the internet. Online learning enables educators to communicate
              with students who may not be capable of enrolling in a traditional classroom course and assists
              students who need to work on their own schedule and at their own speed.</dd></dt></i></h1></font>
        <font face="klee" color="purple">
          <h2><u>Every discipline is registering a surge in the volume of distance learning and imparting of
              online degrees, with remarkable pace. Schools and institutions that offer online education are
              also growing in number. Students pursuing degrees through online methods must be scrupulous in
              ensuring their coursework is completed through a valued and credentialed university.</u></h2></font>

          <h3>Online education is known to offer the benefit of synergy. Here, the format employed makes room
              for dynamic communications between students and the teachers. Through these communications,
              sources are shared, and an open-ended synergy evolves through a learning process. When each 
              person bestows a view or opinion through discussions and comments on others’ work course, it 
              benefits the student to learn better. This unique advantage is manifested in a student-centred 
              virtual learning environment that online learning format alone can contribute.</h3></font>

          <h4>With online classes, we don’t need to travel to a different city or commute long distances. We 
              can stay where we are and keep our current job while we work toward improving our career with an 
              online degree. Online education also helps digital nomads—someone who espouses a technology-enabled 
              or location-independent lifestyle. We can watch lectures and complete our coursework wherever we
              are.</h4></font>

          <h5><i>Whether we are a full-time or part-time online student, the online education experience provides
              a much more manageable schedule. Online education has gained much approval on account of its 
              cheapness. Such is the fact that online courses are more affordable than those offered at schools
              or colleges. While studying in universities, we may have to spend some money such as transportation, 
              lodging, and meals, online education may not require such expenses.</i></h5></font>

          <h6><u>One of the important aspects of online learning is its inherent flexibility, however, there is a
              catch, one has to be extremely self-motivated. The best online students develop various approaches
              for staying up to date on their coursework. Things like setting aside time every week to study and 
              create a workspace with minimal distractions can help immensely.</u></h6></font>
